                Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, secured 
                and object-oriented programming language. Java is an OOP language that was designed to 
                meet the need for the platform-independent language.
                <br><br>
                Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a 
                platform. Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called platform.

            <h2 class="section-header">History of Java</h2>    
            <p class="para-all">
                The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, 
                but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. 
                The history of java starts from Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), 
                initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, 
                televisions etc. But, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was 
                incorporated by Netscape.<br><br>
                The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, 
                Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted and 
                Dynamic". Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions etc.
